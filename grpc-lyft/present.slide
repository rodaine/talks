* Howdy!

- Core Libraries @ Lyft
- Previously Core Platform & DevOps @ VSCO

* Background

* Infrastructure @ Lyft

- PHP Monolith (ongoing decomposition)
- Go "Tier-Zero" core services
- Python (Micro)services
- Envoy network fabric

* What problems are we trying to solve?

- More services = more communication
- 10K's daily errors in our Python services are type related
- Documenting APIs are hard to maintain
- No single source of truth for the shape of our data

* Solution: gRPC and Protocol Buffers!

- Standardize the API definitions and I/O
- Enforce types at the service boundaries
- IDLs become our single source of truth

* Tier-Zero Core Services

* Tier-Zero Core Services

- Primary apps of the business
- Go: type-safety & performance
- proto3-based ODM for MongoDB & DynamoDB
- gRPC interface
- Interceptors used to augment RPC endpoints

* gRPC Unary Interceptor

.code interceptors.go /RequestID/,/END RequestID/

- Logging, metrics, request-scoped info
- RPC/Service independent
- Only one per server, though, so...

* Chaining Interceptors

.code interceptors.go /Chain/,/END Chain/

* Chaining Interceptors

.code interceptors.go /InitServer/,

- Provided with the Lyft "StdLib"

* Future: protoc-gen-go plugin

- Extra type-safety (Request/Response messages)
- Service/RPC level customizability
- Fork required, though ðŸ˜•

* Python Services

* Python Services

- Fronted by Gunicorn + Gevent
- Flask-based HTTP servers
- gRPC clients of tier-zero services
- Want to also be gRPC servers
- Just one issue...

* Gevent + gRPC =

* Envoy

* Envoy

- L7 edge & service proxy
- Modern C++11 codebase
- HTTP/2 & *gRPC*fluent*
- Extensible (L3/4/7) filter architecture

* Goal

_"The_network_should_be_transparent_to_applications._When_network_and_application_problems_do_occur_it_should_be_easy_to_determine_the_source_of_the_problem."_

* Design

- Out of process architecture
- Transparent to applications
- Hot restart

* Features

- Service discovery
- Load balancing
- Health checks
- Mesh routing
- Protocol agnostic
- Robust stats
- Oh, ...and *Open*Source!*

* Topology

* So what about gRPC?

* Code Generation via protoc

- proto2 extensions
- Custom message and field options
- Generated Python client/server (Flask)
- protoc plugin leveraging protoc-gen-go utilities

* Proto Extensions + Options

.code hello.proto

* Generated Server

.code hello.pb.py /SERVER/,/END SERVER/

* Generated Client

.code hello.pb.py /CLIENT/,/END CLIENT/

* Envoy filter to upgrade/downgrade gRPC

* gRPC + Envoy + gEvent =

* Organization & Process

* Difficulties

*protoc*and*plugins:*
- Gnarly installation and API
- Differences in behavior between language plugins

*Previously...*
- Each project rolled their own build
- Divergent versions of protoc and plugins

* Dockerized protoc + plugins

- Pre-baked image with *protoc* and *protoc-gen-**
- Build scripts for each language
- Volume in *./proto/* and *./generated/*
- Use a packagecloud 3.0 deb package

  docker pull lyft_idl     # pull the builder image
  git checkout -b updates  # create a new branch
  vim proto/hello.proto    # modify IDL
  make build               # builds generated code
  git add * && git commit  # Commit IDL + generated

* Lyft IDL Repository

- Single repository for all message and service IDLs
- All languages generated together
- Generated code committed (it's okay, we promise)
- Package manager based versioning (pip / glide)
- CI verifies builds, linting, generated tests

* Live Coding: gRPC KV Store + Envoy + Flask Python Client
